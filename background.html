        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I began my college career in the Fall of 2015. At that time, I was in a deadend job with barely enough to make
             it to the next paycheck and two kids to feed on my own. I had to change that. 
        </p>
        <p>I recalled how much I enjoyed working with computer networks in high school and began researching programs at 
             Lone Star College - Montgomery. I began studying for an Associates degree in Computer Networking wherein 
             I reached a crossroads... I could continue this path, or I could quit being afraid of Mathematics and acquire 
             my Bachelors in Computer Science. I chose to not allow myself to be intimidated any longer.
        </p>
        <p> I graduated December 2020 with my BS in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics from the University of Houston-Downtown.
