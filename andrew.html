    <p>I am a student at University of Houston-Downtown pursuing a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. I have experience and familiarity with Python, Java, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am interested in the world of databases and Data Science. Some hobbies include playing and watching sports (mostly basketball and football), listening to music, spending time with close friends and family, and watching tv shows and movies. I hope this site makes your Computer Science path a lil easier and a bit more enjoyable!</p>
