            <h2 style= "text-shadow: 4px 4px green;"> Background</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone, I am a computer science student at UHD. I am from Houston, Texas
	    and my parents are from Central America. I grew up with a brother and two sisters
	    and we are all really close. As a kid, I was always hyperactive, always trying
	    to do something fun and play all day. This shaped me to be a social person,
	    as well as a friendly guy. During my highschool years, I really started to notice
	    the impact of technology in the world which leaned me towards studying computer science.</p>
	    
	    <h2 style= "text-shadow: 4px 4px green;"> Hobbies</h2>
	    <p>My favorite thing to do is play soccer. Growing up I would always watch soccer
	    games with my family, and it became a family tradition which I grew to love and enjoy.
	    My favorite team in the world is Real Madrid and it is a dream of mine to someday go to 
	    Spain and watch them play. I admire a lot of their players because they worked really
	    hard to achive their dreams and are always ambitious to keep reaching their goals.</p>

	    <p> Another hobby of mine is gaming. As a kid i never owned a game console, instead I 
	    enjoyed the outdoors. However, I had a lot of friends who did and they would always be 
	    talking about certain games with one another. Eventually, I was persuaded to get a 
	    Playstation 3 and after a Playstation 4. I have learned to love the gaming world 
	    especially right now during COVID-19, as I can still talk with a lot of my friends
	    despite not meeting with them in real life. In addition, it also keeps me distracted
	    from the fact that I am stuck at home.</p>

	    <h2 style= "text-shadow: 4px 4px green;"> Food/Entertainment </h2>
	    <p>Another thing that i enjoy doing is going to different places and trying new 
	    foods with my friends. Whether it is a new place that has opened up, a new dish
	    that was added to the menu of a known restaurant, or even trying a plate from
	    a different culture, I am always excited to explore delicious food and stimulate
	    my taste buds. My favorite food is a salvadorian sandwich that my mom makes. 
	    The sandwich is made with a french bread with mustard and mayonaisse mix, and soaked
 	    with a special sauce made from wines which is also used to cook the chicken.
	    It consists of chicken, vegetables(tomato, cucumber, etc.), deviled eggs, and 
	    cabbage salad(coleslaw but just a little different) </p>
