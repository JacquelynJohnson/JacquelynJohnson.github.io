            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I began my college career in the Fall of 2015. At that time, I was in a deadend job with barely enough to make it to the next paycheck and two kids to feed on my own. I had to change that. I remembered that I really enjoyed working with computer networks in high school, so I researched programs at Lone Star College - Montgomery that would be sufficient to launch me into a new career path and make more money. I began studying for an Associates degree in Computer Networking where I came to a crossroads... I could continue this course, or I could quit being afraid of Mathematics and acquire my Bachelors in Computer Science. I chose to not allow myself to be intimidated any longer.</p>
            <p>As I mentioned earlier, I started this journey as a single mother with two children. The year 2020 has been a very strange one, in more than one way. I met an amazing man who holds my same values, he loves me and my kids, and he does everything he can to help me in any way (he even washes the dishes without being asked). We are to marry in January 2021. Below is a picture of all of us together. This degree will enable me to make sure that my family is taken care of for now and the future. It's looking brighter already.</p>
