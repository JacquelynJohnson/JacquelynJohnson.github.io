                            As we all know, troubleshooting electronics can be irritating and difficult.
                            This project took a lighthearted approach to solving recurrent technical issues we,
                            the developers, have encountered when fixing technical problems for a variety of people
                            through the years. By developing this application, we can simply advise someone to 
                            download the app and do their own troubleshooting with the accompanying retorts we always
                            wanted to say. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The app is more for entertainment than it is intended to actually help, but it might still
                            be found helpful by some since we based the questions and answers off our own experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We created three categories for a user to select from: Mobile, Desktop/Laptop, and Console. Based
                            on their selection of a category and how the user answered the questions when prompted, they are shown 
                            responses to potentially solve their problem.
